## About
`HtmlForgeX` is a .NET library that simplifies the creation of HTML content.
It provides a fluent API to create HTML content.
It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and to provide a way to create HTML content in a more readable and maintainable way.

I have similar project [PSWriteHTML](https://github.com/evotecit/PSWriteHTML) for PowerShell that is used by many people. This project aims to provide similar functionality for .NET developers.
